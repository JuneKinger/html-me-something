    <h1>Exploring Goa, India - my roots!</h1>
    <h2>About Goa:</h2>
    <p>Goa is the smallest state in India and offers a fascinating mix of Indian and Portuguese cultures. It is situated on the southwestern coast of India. It is a former Portuguese province. Goa is visited by large numbers of international and 
        domestic tourists each year and is famous for its white sand beaches, nightlife, places of worship, and rich architecture.
         Growing up, my family would spend Summers here in our ancestral home, although I was raised in Mumbai which is 365 miles from Goa.</p>

        <h2>Anjuna, North Goa</h2>
        <p>Anjuna has seen the hippie culture way back in the past and whose flea market 
            held every Wednesday is still one of the largest I have ever seen! This beach is a favorite 
            among foreigners. The stretch of Anjuna Beach is filled with water 
            activities, cafes, coffee shops, family run-guesthouses, and beach bars. 
            Anjuna is also a place known for its small rocks by the sea side. People staying 
            in nearby hotels often walk up to the sea and sit here to watch the sunrise and 
            sip tea or coffe. One of the most carried out activities include jet skiing and para gliding. </p>
